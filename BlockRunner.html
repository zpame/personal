    <h1>Block Runner</h1>
    <div id="BlockRunner"> </p>
        Block Runner was a game I published in December of 2022, it took me about 300 hours to develop over the course of 4 months. I was obsessed with every aspect of developing this game.
        I was pretty busy during this period of my life but I still managed to find a few hours
        every day to devote to this game.
        Most of it was developed without a plan and with very poor organiziational skills, nevertheless I am content with how it turned 
        out for my first game. Overall it was a great learning experience and I am glad I finished it. </p>

    <h2>About Blockrunner</h2>

        <p>
            Block runner is a singleplayer game that involves skill and patience. The objective is to get your character to the finish line whilst avoding obstacles. There is an online leaderboard that tracks
            your speed in each level, allowing for some competitive play. As the player works their way through the campaign mode, they unlock new types of blocks that each have their own unique abilities. The
            player can use these new unlocked blocks in the Progressive Mode. Progressive mode allows the player to select any of the blocks they have already unlocked to play each level. Some levels are only
            possible if you have certain blocks unlocked. <br><br>

            There is also an in-game currency system. You can earn Block Points through playing levels or watching rewarded video ads. Block Bucks can be bought through the in-app purchase system. You can 
            use these currencies to buy in game skins for your block.
