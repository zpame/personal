    <h1>Isolation</h1>
    <div id="Isolation"> </p>
        Isolation is a game that is unreleased, but I have a lot of good programming reps that went into this game. I learned basic animation, more advanced collision detection, UI design, and so much more.
        The downfall of this game and the reason it isn't finished was a major lack of planning. I went into this game with a vague vision for a final result. This ended up costing me a lot of time programming
        and developing slowly because I didn't know what I wanted. I am not opposed to going back and finishing this game one day, but I was unable to finish it with no clear direction on where to go... To be clear
        I am still very happy I started this project and it is time well spent, I learned a lot and it helped me develop as a game designer. </p>
