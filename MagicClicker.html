        Magic Clicker is a game I have developed very recently. I just released a private alpha testing version of the game to a few close friends. I like to test my games first before releasing them publicly.
        It allows me to get rid of some of the big bugs early. This game is very well rounded, decent graphics, decent animations, and all around fun gameplay. I have so many ideas for this game so I am very
        excited to continue working on it and hopefully release a full version to the app store in the next few months.</p>

        <p>
            Magic Clicker is an idle game that is easy to understand but also has the potential to be a very complicated single-player experience.
            The user earns Mana by clicking on the center of the screen, the more Mana they earn the more upgrades they are able to unlock and earn more mana.
            The game is still in very early works but I have very bright plans for how I will continue to work on the game.<br><br>
